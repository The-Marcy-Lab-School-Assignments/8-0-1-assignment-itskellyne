# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer
    A middleware function is different from a normal controller because its a function that can also parse requests and perform server side actions. Middleware pass the request to the next function in the chain instead of sending a response to the client. Middleware also uses app.use to execute middleware for all routes.
